A simple Text File (Experimental Branch_01 and Branch_02 and Branch_03)



This is a simple Text File created directly into our repository.

We'll use it to learn Github basics.

I'm adding a new line just to do another commit and create a minimum commits history.

After this line we'll learn about Branches.

This is a modification made on Branch_01.

This is a modification made on Branch_02.

With Branch_03 we'll try to merge Branch_03 and Main both after they've modified the same line.

This line should be the same modified by Branch_03. Infact we had to resolve it manually!!!

This change has been made from another repository that has forked this project.

New line from Fork.
